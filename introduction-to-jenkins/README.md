# Introduction to Jenkins

Using a basic JS project (generated using create react app), we'll install, build, test, and deploy our application to a docker instance.

* Begin by ensuring you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* Follow the simple demo steps under, https://jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/
