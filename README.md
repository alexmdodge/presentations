# Learning
A general repository for learning material and my own personal strategies. Here I'll organize some personal goals, what I've accomplished so far, and what resources I've discovered along the way.

# Overall Goals
As a web developer I want to make myself valuable to the company by remaining skillful in a broad sense, but also specializing in a way that gives me a unique edge. I want to be seen as someone who takes their work seriously, is passionate, and is considerate of others and how they work. 

By using this opportunity to grow as a developer and professional I want to use my skills to help others, build future technologies which will shape the next generation, and educate others to become better at what they do. There are a number of domains and areas of growth I want to focus on.

# Areas of Growth

| Domain | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Interactions](#interactions) | This generally relates to human interaction throughout the day. I encounter many situations during the day where my interactions can be more effective, more concerted, less distracting, and more considerate. Again I need to almost set little reminders for myself as cues for some of the different areas I interact in.
| [Organization](#organization) | This area of growth has a lot of different components. I currently have a number of different ways I organize work, but they can sometimes stay scattered, and I find myself sinking large amounts of time trying to organize what I'm going to do. This also relates to organization pertaining to my programming environment and setup.
| [Efficiency](#efficiency) | This has it's own because in a way it relates to my efficiency to process a task when it's assigned to me. That's the big thing, it's the *process* of getting setup and working, and not the actual task itself.
| [Programming](#programming) | The largest and undoubtedly the most important. This section will have a number of smaller sections for topics, languages, and general programming concepts to improve my understanding.
| [Prescence](#prescence) | How do others view me externally to REDspace? Do I contribute to open source in a serious way? Do I write articles and present infromation about what I've learned in a unique way.
