# TypeScript Tsconfig Breakdown

This repository contains bite size chunks of projects that demonstrate some of the many different features and settings the tsconfig provides.

```sh
npm install -g typescript
tsc --init
```

## Section Breakdown

1. Base Config - What we get out of the box
2. Target Settings - What features we're compiling for, what support is known
3. Module Settings - How modules (`export`) is set to interact with each other, how they are wrapped
4. Including Files - Individual files in the project
5. Include, Exclude, and Output - Specifying more broadly our input output and ignored files
